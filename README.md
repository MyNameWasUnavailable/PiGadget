# PZeroGadget

I was looking for a project that allowed me to setup a PI Zero as a USB keyboard with Rndis networking.

I wasnt able to find anything that was exactly what I wanted, however there were a few that were close!

This project is heavily based on the work of others, and I do not claim this to be of my own creation, I simply re-packaged and picked through, and used the pieces of the projects I needed.

Projects I have based this on, include:
https://github.com/gilyes/pi-shutdown
https://github.com/mame82/P4wnP1
